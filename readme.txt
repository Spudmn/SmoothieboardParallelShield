Smoothieboard Parallel Shield

Licensed under the CERN Open Hardware License version 1.2

This pcb makes connecting a Parallel CNC Machine and the common Reprap Discount GLCD Screen to a Smoothieboard very easy. It has an optional footprint for a 5V regulator to make sure the screen gets enough power. Information on how to configure Smoothieware for use with a display panel can be found here: http://smoothieware.org/panel
